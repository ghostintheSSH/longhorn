Without proper security, you are an open book... with security, you are preventing the inevitable

Project Longhorn is an AIO Hardening script that is meant to be dynamic and modular. Meant to recognize popular installed services, it has the ability to harden and protect an instance in one script. This idea was concieved while everyone was running one way, I stepped back and viewed the issue. Hardening in itself is a long and complicated process. System admins do not have the time or skill set to properly harden a system. This script, ultimately, does it for them, while up to par with popular standards.

Project Longhorn, while being free and open source will have it's own Gihhub repository where I will provide updates and changes to the script. I am planning on upkeeping this script well beyond graduation, as the project as it for one OS Distro choice is doable in this SIP's timeframe. Multiple Distros will take longer to complete. The goal is to release a fully compatible and fully tested on muliple OS builds where they have been put to the test againt red team and validated by a blue team. This may turn into a full framework in the future as well, however, I hope I am able to secure someone's box, one script at a time.
